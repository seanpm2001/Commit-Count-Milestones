## [Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)](#Frequently-Asked-Questions-FAQ)

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b><u>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section (FAQ)</u></b></p></summary>

Since no-one has asked anything yet, I will answer the first common question I can think of.

### [What is with the random numbers? 65536, 1048576, etc.](#What-is-with-the-random-numbers-65536-1048576-etc)

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b><u>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section (FAQ question #1)</u></b></p></summary>

These numbers aren't random. I included every power of 2 from 2^4 (16) to 2^20 (1048576) 2^16 = 65536, 2^20 = 1048576 and so on. Some other not so common numbers (such as 270,000) were included, as they are unique numbers to me.

## [Software tools](#Software-tools)

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b><u>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section (software tools)</u></b></p></summary>

I am developing software tools to ease and aid the development of lists, and also allow others to do similar. The project is written in Python. It is under the same license as the source project, and can be found [here](/Tools/CCM/)
