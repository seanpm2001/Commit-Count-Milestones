## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Since no-one has asked anything yet, I will answer the first common question I can think of.

### What is with the random numbers? 65536, 1048576, etc.

These numbers aren't random. I included every power of 2 from 2^4 (16) to 2^20 (1048576) 2^16 = 65536, 2^20 = 1048576 and so on. Some other not so common numbers (such as 270,000) were included, as they are unique numbers to me.
