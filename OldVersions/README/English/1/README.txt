## [Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)](#Frequently-Asked-Questions-FAQ)

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b><u>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section (FAQ)</u></b></p></summary>

Since no-one has asked anything yet, I will answer the first common question I can think of.

### [What is with the random numbers? 65536, 1048576, etc.](#What-is-with-the-random-numbers-65536-1048576-etc)

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b><u>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section (FAQ question #1)</u></b></p></summary>

These numbers aren't random. I included every power of 2 from 2^4 (16) to 2^20 (1048576) 2^16 = 65536, 2^20 = 1048576 and so on. Some other not so common numbers (such as 270,000) were included, as they are unique numbers to me. 

#### Powers of 2 Reference
